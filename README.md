### About me ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Mariana FernÃ¡ndez-Espinosa. I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, advised by Dr. Diego GÃ³mez-Zara.
My research focuses on generative AI and spatial computing. I develop and analyze novel methods and systems that facilitate collaboration between teams in extended reality spaces, with a focus on Human-AI interactions. I am particularly interested in how integrating AI with immersive technologies can enable teams to achieve innovative results and enhanced experiences. Additionally, I explore the potential of generative AI to boost creativity, support decision-making processes, and facilitate task delegation between teams and AI in virtual reality environments.
